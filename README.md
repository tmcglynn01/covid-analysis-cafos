# Corellation between CAFOs and COVID-19

To what extent does large-scale animal agriculture have on the COVID-19 cases in a given region?

Areas across the midwest, which is traditionally dominant in processing animal products, are experiencing massive increases in COVID-19 cases. These areas were generally able to stave off the initial surges of COVID-19 in the spring, but spread quietly over the summer before experiecing massive increases in the late-summer, early fall.

For many of these regions, the earliest outbreaks of the coronavirus came through meatpacking plants. A typical worker at these meatpacking plants lives a life segregated from the general population, due to cultural barriers including language and, arguably in some of these regions, racism--I say this having watched much of it first-hand in Green Bay, Wisc.<sup>[0]</sup> Today, evidence of racial segregation continues to arise<sup>[1]</sup>, which begs the quesion:

> With the early arrival of COVID-19 in meatpacking plants, was the virus able to incubate and spread across these communities from the summer into the spring?

This hypothesis is strengthened by the following:

* Air pollution from CAFOs and meatpacking plants<sup>[2]</sup> is shown to cause respiratory issues in close proximity
* There is a "significant relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 infection"<sup>[2]</sup>
* That the coronavirus spreads airborne and would be worst in tight, enclosed spaces<sup>[3]</sup> (which meatpacking plants would be)
* That the severity of the outbreaks in these regions is made worse by proximity to meatpacking plants, and that the explosion of cases in the late summer stemmed from superspreader events (like Sturgis) carrying the virus to communities where the spread of the disease was already unchecked and accelerated its explosion in its respective regions.

Overall, there should be a strong correlation of total COVID cases per capita and proximity to animal agriculture production.
